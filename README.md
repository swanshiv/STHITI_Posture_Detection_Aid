## Introduction

The STHITI project is a crucial part of the D.U.A. mission, aiming to empower individuals with unique abilities to lead more comfortable and independent lives. By utilizing adaptive technology, STHITI focuses on promoting correct posture and spinal alignment, which plays a crucial role in overall health and well-being.

## Features

- **Posture Correction:** STHITI helps users maintain a correct posture by monitoring the position of the neck and spinal cord.

- **Sensor-based Feedback:** The project uses sensor data to detect deviations from the desired posture. When incorrect posture is detected, the system provides feedback through auditory cues, such as beeping sounds.

- **Adaptive Assistance:** STHITI's adaptive technology offers real-time assistance, helping users make immediate posture adjustments.

- **Customizable Alerts:** Users can customize the alert settings based on their preferences and needs.

## Hardware Platform

STHITI is designed to work with the Arduino UNO platform, leveraging its capabilities for sensor integration and feedback mechanisms.

## Installation

This repository contains the necessary code and resources for the STHITI project. To get started, you'll need an Arduino UNO board, compatible sensors, and the components specified in the project documentation.

## Usage

1. Set up the hardware components according to the provided documentation.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino UNO board.
3. Wear or place the device in a way that allows it to monitor your neck and spinal alignment.
4. As you go about your activities, listen for the auditory cues (beeping sounds) that indicate incorrect posture.
5. Make posture adjustments based on the feedback provided by the device.
